# CLUSTERING CHALLENGE

## THE MISSION

Your boss was happy with your previous work on the bearing analysis, guessing faulty bearings was a piece of cake for you! The team came back to you for further expertise; They want to know what type of failures occur! Or rather, if the failures exhibit similarities to other failures. This is a perfect clustering challenge.
