# Challenge Bearing Clustering

## Description

After the bearing analysis where faulty bearings were predicted in the [classification challenge](https://github.com/Roldan87/challenge-classification.git), this challenge aims to cluster what type of failures occur. Or rather, if the failures exhibit similarities to other failures.

### KMeans Clustering Model

"Silhouette coefficients (as these values are referred to as) near +1 indicate that the sample is far away from the neighboring clusters. A value of 0 indicates that the sample is on or very close to the decision boundary between two neighboring clusters and negative values indicate that those samples might have been assigned to the wrong cluster.
Also from the thickness of the silhouette plot the cluster size can be visualized."

### Feature Extraction
#### 99 rows Ã— 27 columns

#### Silhouette Score Evolution
The silhouette score differs from 2 features (red line) compared to 3/4/5 or 6 features (lines overlapped). After 3 features the addition of features doesn't affect the scores.

## Conclusion

##### The features proved to be the best for clustering after all combinations were:

* *a2_x_mean*: Mean Value of sensor 2 readings in X-axis
* *a2_x_amp_max*: Maximum Amplitude of sensor 2 readings in X-axis
* *a1_x_amp_max*: Maximum Amplitude of sensor 1 readings in X-axis

##### Sklearn Model used for clustering challenge:

* *KMeans*
* Highest Silhouette Score (2 features / 2 clusters) = 0.84
* 2nd highest Sil. Score (2 features / 2 clusters) = 0.72
* Avg Sil. Avg Score (2 features / 2-7 clusters) = 0.57
* Best Sil. Avg Score (3-6 features / 2-7 clusters) = 0.61

##### Other Clustering models tried:

* *Agglomerative Clustering*      --> max Score = 0.88
* *MeanShift*                     --> max Score = 0.50
* *Spactral Clustering*           --> max Score = 0.11
